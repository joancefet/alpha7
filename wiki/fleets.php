	<h1>Fleets</h1>
            Now we consider the exact piece of New Order, the only way to steal ressource from your ennemies and to become a true hooror for them. Right! The fleet. <p>
            
All ships can perform perform various objectives: attack - to attack a planet, transportation - to deliver the resources and come back, All ressource tramsported remains at the endpoint. All these tasks are possible to the planets, and moons.
To start the construction of the fleet, you should built shipyard, robotic factory, nanites and conveyors.

<p>

Also be aware that when you remove something from the shipyard queu, you got only 60% of the resource back . <p />
 <p>
Speed ​​is one of the most important characteristics of the fleet and it depends on the study of combustion , impulsive and hyperspace engines. The higher the level of research engine , the faster your ships can perform certain tasks (transport , attack, espionage) . Speed ​​is not enough , believe it "bread" especially for the attacker . <p />

        fleet can perform many operations, including the following: <ul>
<li><b>espionage</b>. Mission, which provides information about other planets and players. For this mission, you can only use spy probes.
<li><b>hold</b>. This mission, which allows your fleet to protect the planet/moon of another player. To successfully complete the mission you must be sure that the two conditions has been met:<ol>
<li> The players you want to proctect must be either your friend or be in your ally.
<li>Players have to build on hes planet or moon the <b> Alliance depot</b>. <p />
The mission can be sent in 7 time periods: <br />
1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 32 hours.

  <script language = "JavaScript">
var bigsize = "750"; //Размер большой картинки
var smallsize = "160"; //Размер маленькой картинки
function changeSizeImage(im) {
  if(im.height == bigsize) im.height = smallsize;
  else im.height = bigsize;
}
</script>   
Here as denoted mission review fleets:

            <img style="border-radius:10px" src="html/images/9/1.png">
</ol>


<li><b>transport</b>. The mission, which is available to all players regardless of level, this means that top1 can send ressource to anyone, even if the other players is shown in noob protection. But don't forget that a lower ranked player can not send ressource to a higher ranked one without having anythin in return. This falls under the rule of pushing and can be punished with ban. <p>
you can absolutly send any fleets in this mission
<li><b>deploy</b> – mission, allowing you to move fleets, but only between your planets and (or) moons.. usually used for fleetsave. all ships can participate in this mission.

<li><b>Recycle</b> – mission, which allows you to fly to a field of debris and recycle. The fleet must be present recyclers (or giga recyclers)
<li><b>destroy</b> – it involves the destruction of the ennemy moon . Also requires the fulfillment of several conditions: <ol>
<li> Fleet should be send to the moon and the fleet must be composed with minumum one death star
<li> The officer shredder must be activated.
The downside of this mission is that the deat star is very slow and during the flight the enemy can prevent the destruction of the moon ( to build defenses stars could not pierce it ) , so you need to follow the drift and if your fleet exceeds the force of the moon whose you are trying to break, you can sometimes send their fleet to attack , as if to sweep before demolition . the attack is desirable to do with a gap of 1-5 seconds before the deatstarts approach to the moon .</ol>


<li><b>attack</b>. The mission, which allows you to rip the planet or moon of another player. this mission is not avaible for 2 ships: scappy and spy probe. They do not even participate in battles as the defending side. <p>
Also has its own mission Attack feature - the ability to create <b> ACS </b>. To start <p> what is ACS attack .. ACS - using ACS you can combine your fleet with the fleet (or fleets) from your friends or ally members. All fleets, exiled in the ACS are aligned to the slowest ship of the ACS. <p>


Now how to turn normal attack in ACS-attack:


<script language = "JavaScript">
var bigsize = "700"; //Размер большой картинки
var smallsize = "70"; //Размер маленькой картинки
function changeSizeImage3(im) {
  if(im.height == bigsize) im.height = smallsize;
  else im.height = bigsize;
}
</script> 

<script language = "JavaScript">
var bigsize = "500"; //Размер большой картинки
var smallsize = "200"; //Размер маленькой картинки
function changeSizeImage111(im) {
  if(im.height == bigsize) im.height = smallsize;
  else im.height = bigsize;
}
</script> 

<li> simply send a fleet to attack.
<li> go in the fleet table menu and press the ACS button <br />
 <img style="border-radius:10px"  height="70" src="html/images/9/2.png">
<li>	In the field that I've highlighted in the image enter nickname of the player you want to invite in the ACS <br /> 
 <img style="border-radius:10px"  height="120" src="html/images/9/3.png" >
<li>	The player, which you sent the invitation in the ACS, after selecting the fleet in the selection menu will now coordinate with the line <br />
 <img style="border-radius:10px"  height="500" src=" http://funkyimg.com/u2/3102/428/454345screenshot_2013-02-19_001.png" >

<li>	Please click on this line and the coordinates are automatically changed to the ones where the player flies a fleet founder Saba
<li> menu, select the job chosen jointly attack :<br />
<img style="border-radius:10px"  height="200" src=" http://funkyimg.com/u2/3102/437/427891screenshot_2013-02-19_001.png"> <p>

SAB can be used a little differently: that's like you forgot to add some ships attack you through the subwoofer can send their "booster". <br /> To do this, simply enter the player's nickname (paragraph 3) and select fleets, which you want to add, and then all the action also the same that have been described above.
<p>


<li> 	<b>expedition.</b> This mission involves sending a fleet near position 16 in the system. The most dangerous mission, as its outcome no one can predict. In the expedition is not allowed to send spy probes and scrappys. <p>
There are to ways to send out expeditions:
<ol>
<li> Galaxy: for this, click on the "deep area of galaxy" link<br />




<img style="border-radius:10px"  height="300" src="html/images/9/4.png" >
<br />

Next, choose the fleet and send to expeditions.<li>	Fleet menu: the choice of coordinates, just enter the coordinates of the planet to 16.<br /> 

<script language = "JavaScript">
var bigsize = "250"; //Размер большой картинки
var smallsize = "70"; //Размер маленькой картинки
function changeSizeImage5(im) {
  if(im.height == bigsize) im.height = smallsize;
  else im.height = bigsize;
}
</script>



<img style="border-radius:10px"  height="70" src="html/images/9/5.png" onclick="changeSizeImage5(this)">
<p>

Often the question arises: how to increase the amount of non-recurring expeditions? <p> <ul>
<li> Option 1. Bleed research expedition. No. expeditions equals the square root of the level of Astrophysics. For example, at level 25 is available for Astrophysics 5 expeditions, and at 36 - 6.
<li> Option 2. With premium account, namely using Quantity "expedition."<br />
Now a little talk about the chances of events Expeditions: <p> </ul>

<div style="border:1px #CCCCCC solid; margin-bottom:10px;">

<li> <b> Colonize </b>. The mission is to colonize new planets.
<li> <b> Dark Matter Search </b>. For this mission, there is special. Ship - Dark Matter Collector. It is necessary to send your fleets to a moon and select the research dark matter mission.

           <font class="tekst"> <a  style="text-decoration:none; color:#666666; margin-bottom:10px;" name="seiv"> Fleet save</a></font><br>
         Fleet save - this is the action that each player should be able to do, regardless of its specialization ( miner or attacker ) . <br />
raiders usualy save their fleets, usually together, while a miner must know how to save their resources . <p>
 <p>

You can save your ressource with buildings and research, ie developing expensive and lengthy studies , and then cancel them , but it is not very convenient . <br />
Much more convenient to save is using your fleet. But it requires certain skills : calculation of flight time for the arrival of the fleet to be sure you are online and could meet him ; logic , that is an option to always be thinking that the enemy can break your moon and see your fleets, its best to fleetsave using the deploy mission as the phalanx cant scan it when its on the return way. <p>

We begin our discussion with the help of the fleet saves . <p>
For any saves with the fleet we need ships , which will lead to resources themselves (this may be SC , LC , RECS or Giga reyclers ) as well as a correct moon if you want to stay hidden for your ennemies. <p>
Also, depending on how long the you want so save, you need to choose the slowest ship : scrappy, deatstar or darkmatter collector.
<ul>
<li> scrappy can be used to save for 3-4 days without recalling it , ie if i save my fleets wwith the deploy mission, you can recall it later to keep the fleet in the air for about a week ..
<li> DM Collector saves for 6-15 hours depending on the speed of the player
<li> Deathstars from about 12 to 20 hours in one direction.
</ul>


<center><h4>Saves on deploy between your moons (colonies)</h4></center><p>
The safest and most correct ways to saves. For it is necessary to know how much time you want to send a fleet away, choose the best planet flight duration which will suit you online times. <nr> You should always be sure you will be back on time, because the flight can be lanxed when a players destroy your moon, this give you a chance to recall your fleets and to keep them save. it is better to recall the fleet to have more chances. <p>
Another problem is that by recalling the fleet. It can get back to you at an inconvenient time, such as at night , so before sending the fleet, you should need to calculate some option before sending.. <p>

In principle, you can save this way without moons, but there is a chance that someone decides to catch you when he noticed the time of fly away and the time when you recall it. This course is very difficult and requires a large quantity of the fleet, but for the sake of standing production, some players may take the risk. <p>
And I want to mention one more thing: Best to save from moons to moons and to build at least some defense on it. because not everyone will want to risk a large fleet to destroy the moon with a strong defense. <p>

<center><h4> Saves on "hold"</h4></center><p>
About the mission and the mission Keep conditions you can read a little higher. <br />
For saves to keep or do you need a strong partner to which you can send a fleet , but agree that we can not exclude the possibility of an attack on that player and then your fleet will be in danger. <br />
You can also send and Hold on a weak player , but again there is the option to attack this player . <p>

Keep fleet better to send only the moon , because if you send it to the planet Stay phalanx may notice your save game , and as the moon phalanx of view it is impossible, and a save game on the moon phalanx not see . To check whether there is a save game on the moon to send a fleet to attack the moon (not a large fleet , but strong enough to hold on to the second round ) . As an example of such a fleet can provide the following composition: 1000000 LEE and 100 Onillov or drugs.
In conclusion we can say that this save game is quite simple and convenient, but it is very dangerous . <p>

<center><h4> SAV of "attack"</h4></center><p>

This save game is also very dangerous because it is viewed as a phalanx during the flight and after the flight. Yet another drawback is that this saves that flight can not take on the Attack Seiver therefore a save game can not be a pancake time . Analogue saver when such saves, can serve as the AP , but as I mentioned earlier the duration of such limited saves . <p>
If you have decided this way Saves Navy bother to pick up such a sacrifice to your fleet vyigryal lossless on your part , otherwise what's the point in that if your Saves fleet will then be destroyed ?<p>

 <center><h4>Saves using Expeditions</h4></center><p>
 
Also extremely dangerous saves, because the result eskpeditsii impossible to predict, and this saves time Unlimited 5.6 hours, which is not suitable for saves for the night, but basically saves for a short time. It should be noted that since the save game phalanx seen in both stages of the flight, this saves on costs too refuse. <p>

  <center><h4>Saves the fields of debris mission Recycle.</h4></center><p>
Another dangerous save in mind visibility phalanx both phases of flight . In the save game , you can send any ships is so saves time , you can choose how much it allows speed saver , but do not forget that in the fleet must be present or Mega Processors processors . <p>
Incidentally another minus saves this - is that the phalanx can see this save game , proskaniv phalanx planet on which flies to save from recycling. Not always easy to find the debris field on the right coordinates for you , and do not always convenient software , because the enemy can not understand it . <p>
Saves can and software, which is near the planet where you want to send a save game . But this time also saves very little , so the speed x1000 this save game can be used for mini- saves time by about half an hour .
