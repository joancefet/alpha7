	  In 2170 was opened on technology to provide travel through subspace to distant galaxies. The first expedition was undertaken in 2190, after 20 years of preparation and construction of 12 ships carriers. 
	Unfortunately, fortune smiled travelers... 
	<br>  about the passage through subspace ships came under the influence of an unknown science artifact - a huge energy body shape and weight unknown.
This body radiates energy waves that demented ships and crew pulled out their mind. 
	<br>  The only thing that saved the crew - flight path tangent.
The ships were in terrible condition and only a few ships managed to land right, the rest fall apart, entering the planet's atmosphere.
	<br>  Survivors started a new life, losing part of his memory and his past ... They had no choice left but to move forward, to new lands.
