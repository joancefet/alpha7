<div style="display:  none; clear: both;" id="id_2">

the position of the planet in the system affects the number of fields on the planet, and the temperature of it.

with a higher planet temperature, solar satellite power generation increases and deuterium synthesizer production decreases.
with a lower planet temperature, production of deuterium increase but production of energy from solar satelits decrease.
the number of fields on the colonized planet can be increased by examining "Astrophysics" with each level the maximum number of fields in each position is incremented by 1
production of solar satelits can be increased in the academy section

	•	jumpgate - allows you to instantly jump your fleet (without resources) from one moon to another moon. On the second moon must also be built a jumpgate. after the jump is done, it will take some time before the next use. on the first level time = 1h, with each level of the jumpgate time is reduced by two times
<br>
•	sensor phalanx - allows you to view the fleets running form the enemy planet. fleets send to moons are not visible when lanxing the planet! the formula for calculating the range of the phalanx is as follows: (level squared) - 1, ie at the level 6 of phalanx sensor, the range = 35<br>
below i propose to look missions visible for the phalanx sensor<br>
